    "   `decode.exe code.dat input.enc decoded.txt`\n",

    "      - `code.dat`: a file containing the code to be used (known as the \"codebook\" file)\n",
    "      - `input.enc`: the file to decode, obtained with the encoding application from last week\n",
    "      - `decoded.txt`: the output decoded file\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The program will follow the following steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1. Read the full vector from the codebook file;\n",
    "    2. Read the full input encoded file, in the same order as we wrote the data last week:\n",
    "        - read first an integer\n",
    "        - then read everything else into an array `vec` of type `unsigned char`, of max size 1MB (i.e. 1.000.000 bytes);\n",

    "             - Check all codewords and see which one matches the next bits;\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Decode a file with the codebook from the other language. How does the output look like?\n",
